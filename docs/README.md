# Usage

To power up the board, plug a USB-C cable into the port labeled PWR.

The SBC can boot either from a SD-Card, or the eMMC.

## Linux

This board should be compatiable with the Orange Pi Linux images! But I might make my own Linux image when I get my hands on the boards.

## Android

Check out the https://www.h3droid.com/ project! I'll try and port it over when I have time.

## Debugging

You can find the UART pins on the top-left corner of the PCB, in the up-to-down order of GND, TX, RX.

The CPU's debug software and manual can be downloaded [here](https://mega.nz/folder/dRNDiaLS#P0zxg4pFopMfrBjBBBc2VA).
